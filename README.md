An HTML boilerplate with Bootstrap 4.x.x using Gulp, Browsersync, and SCSS workflow.

## Setting up your environment
Before we get started, make sure to download https://nodejs.org/en/.

1. Clone this repo: https://github.com/dbybanez/gulp-boilerplate.git
2. After cloning, go to the directory of the project.
3. Run `npm init` and go through the initial setup. (Optional)
4. Run `npm install` this will install `gulp`, `gulp-cli`, `gulp-sass`, `browser-sync`, `gulp-clean-css`, `gulp-rename`, and `bootstrap`.
5. Make sure to update the bootstrap scss links under `app` -> `scss` -> `bootstrap.scss` and `bootstrap` -> `bootstrap.scss`.

And that's it. You're good to go with your first Gulp workflow!
